# flexsc(osdi 2010)

See [summary of this work](https://www.slideshare.net/YongraeJo/flexsc-159944810)

If you are interest in flexsc, reference [kernel module](https://github.com/rupc/flexsc/blob/master/flexsc/module/syshook.c). Other dirty things are just the result of trial and error
---

trying to implement flexsc on ubuntu-linux 4.4.0. At now, codebase is dirty & messy :( :mag: 

## Key idea of implementing FlexSC
- Shared memory between kernel thread and user thread in user space(**Not in kernel space**) so that any kernel thread(called systhread in FlexSC) can access the shared memory
- Asynchronous process of system call through workqueue interface

## Memory mapping API 
- [remap_pfn_range - remap kernel memory to userspace](http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L1876)
- [kmap, kunmap](http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/highmem.h#L56)
- [High memory & Low Memory](http://egloos.zum.com/slgi97/v/10973585): mapping with HIGH_MEM of user process

## Few Notes
If you have a plan to make use of kernel_thread() in user context(when system call), annoying segfault error message arises. So you should take *different approach* to FlexSC because at the time when the paper is written(linux 2.6), it is possible to simply call kernel_thread() to create kernel_thread with sharing memory of calling user space process. But on recent kernel, kernel_thread() with (CLONE_FILES | CLONE_FD | CLONE_VM) flag causes segmentation fault. (See [kernel_thread() causes segfault](http://www.spinics.net/lists/newbies/msg57445.html))
